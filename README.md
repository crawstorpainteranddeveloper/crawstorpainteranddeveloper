HelloðŸ‘‹ everyone you are now you are on my GitHub profile,
I'm a developer or artist who is going to program games and mods for games,
Of course now I'm working on a mod on Friday Night Funkin and I'm thinking of a concept for my horror called
(Escape From The Darkness of Memories) The name is certainly not very good, but in the future I I'll come up with a better idea,
I'm going to release links to my games here, 
I will talk news about something of my own on YouTube in the community and on Instagram and probably on Twitter.
Here's a link to my YouTube channel - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXkXryMQTGHHRIB4AU6biLg and on Instagram - I haven't yet created the same thing with Twitter. 
Let's talk about the end of the text :)
